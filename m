Hi Arnd,

Sorry for the delayed response here - I thought I had replied to everything then
went off for holiday. Now I'm back and I noticed I missed this...

The CLA spec states that there is 1 CLA per CPU. But there is nothing inherrent
about the design that would prevent it from being extended to support multiple
CLAs per CPU AFAICT. The approach I've taken in the RFC would naturally work
under this (unlikely) possibility.

I've spent some time thinking about this today with Jean-Philippe and I believe
we have a proposal that addresses your concerns, (although I confess I haven't
understood exactly what you mean in all of your above bullets).

I think the aim is to allow a sysadmin to disable a class of accelerators
without having to disable any other class of accelerators?

Let's start with an example topology:
- System has 3 CLAs:
   - CLA1 has 2 accelerators:
      - ACC1: type=compute
      - ACC2: type=aes
   - CLA2 has 2 accelerators:
      - ACC3: type=compute
      - ACC4: type=compute
   - CLA3 has 1 accelerator:
      - ACC5: type=compute

We have 1 char device per accelerator type; so in this case, 2 files:
- compute
- aes

When "compute" is mmap'ed, it will contain 3 CLAs; CLA1, CLA2, CLA3. When
queried, it will report that CLA1 has 1 accelerator (ACC1), CLA2 has 2
accelerators (ACC3, ACC4) and CLA3 has 1 accelerator (ACC5). When CLA1, CLA2 and
CLA3 are assigned to the process via this context, their availability masks will
be set so that ACC2 can't be accessed.

When "aes" is mmap'ed, it will contain 1 CLA; CLA1. When queried, it will report
that CLA1 has 1 accelerator (ACC2). When CLA1 is assigned to the process via
this context, its availability mask will be set so that ACC1 can't be accessed.

This scheme wouldn't allow different accelerator types to occupy the same
context, but that could be addressed in future by adding an operation to allow
the user to move an accelerator into a shared context. I don't see a need for
this right now though.

In practice, the kernel driver would infer the accelerator type from it's IIDR
(and possibly DEVARCH and REVIDR) register(s) and group them based on that.

For a system that only has 1 type of accelerator (the expected common case) we
end up with something very similar to what we have in the RFC (a single device
file). But for the case where we have multiple accelerator types, a sysadmin can
easily disable a specific class of accelerators if found to be buggy.

What do you think?

Thanks,
Ryan
