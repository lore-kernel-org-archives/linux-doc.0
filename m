You are right regarding CAP_SYS_PTRACE but this capability is not the only 
one which is used by perf_events for security checks, so the capabilities 
clarification is kept aside of these patches, because patches initial intention 
is to clarify security specifics of sysctl_perf_even_paranoid settings.

I agree that the document can be extended with details clarifying capabilities 
used by perf_events for security checks.

Accepted.
