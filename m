I suspect that might be sufficient. It certainly is for the use-cases
I'm aware of. You always want a system/control set which runs the
regular busy work of running a system.

Then you have one (or more) partitions to run your 'important' work.

Not sure what you're asking. "consume all" is allowing sub-partitions to
allocate all CPUs of the parent, such that there are none left.

"fully-partitioned" is N cpus but no load-balancing, also equivalent to
N 1 CPU parititions.

They are distinct things. Disabling load-balancing should not affect how
many CPUs can be allocated to sub-partitions, the moment you hit 1 CPU
the load balancing is effectively off already. Going down to 0 CPUs
isn't a problem for the load-balancer, it wasn't doing anything anyway.

So the question is if someone really needs the one partition without
balancing over N separate paritions.
