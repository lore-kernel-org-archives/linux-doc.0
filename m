Suren, if you've not been following this, there is a question you
might be best equipped to answer below.

Android monitors psi to kill on excessive pressure. This should
capture thrashing from over compression.

Suren is CC'd, we should get his opinion.

I agree that overcommit control can be useful. But there are setups
that implement pressure-based policies and do utilization monitoring
just fine from userspace; they have no need for logical overcommit
bounds inside the kernel itself. *Defaulting* to a static limit and/or
making a choice mandatory seems like a mistake to me. It would make
more sense to treat this as a related but separate problem.

I'm happy to brainstorm solutions. But we should be open to discussing
this from scratch - userspace monitoring; an extension of
/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_* etc.

A path for memsw in cgroup2 is generally unlikely, actually. It was
intentionally split into separate memory and swap counters and not
forward-ported as a combined control.

Like I said, we should discuss overcommit control from scratch as an
orthogonal issue. I'm happy to do this and help find a solution. But I
want to get out of repeating that this is not compatible with cgroup2.

Here too I think we should be open about discussing the problem and
what a solution could look like.

"Swapoff" seems to presume the virtual space in the shape of a
manageable swapfile through standard interfaces.

A separate knob to clear out the vswap space would accomplish the same
functionality without pulling in the entire swapfile interface e.g.

+1

It would be good to collect usecases first. Interfaces are forever and
we shouldn't add them on speculation.

Here I think we're actually least aligned.

The VM_SPARSE implementation requires a static size, and prior
discussion has made it clear that we actually have no consensus on how
to pick reasonable values - be it in the kernel or in userspace.

The xarray proposal requires none of these choices or interfaces, and
nobody has been able to show that it's actually a performance concern.
