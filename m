This can be solved by simply not using the Zygote model :p Or perhaps
MADV_DONTNEED/straight up unmapping libraries you don't need in the child's
side.

So, we've discussed this before. I initially liked this idea a lot more.
However, there are a couple of problems here:

1) mshare (as in the mshare feature) isn't really aiming for transparent here.
There is e.g a specific need to setup an mshare region, with a few files/anon
there, and then later mprotect/munmap parts of the region - and have it apply
on every process that has it mapped. This is why we're aiming for different
system calls (not ioctls anymore), doing munmap(mshare_reg, 4096) is ambiguous
as to whether you want to unmap the mshare VMA, or a VMA inside the mshare mm.

2) Sharing the page table at all (even worse so, Transparently(tm)) is a huge
pain. TLB shootdown becomes much harder, and rmap as-is isn't suited to deal
with this case. The way things are going with mshare, the container mm will
have one single entry in rmap, and then actually doing the shootdown is a
huuuuge pain (which, fwiw, will probably need a per-mshare TLB workaround),
because you need to find out and shoot down _every_ mm that has these tables
mapped. And then, naturally, since you're sharing page tables, doing A/D bit
collection on these becomes extremely useless - and that will naturally pose
problems to the reclaim process if you abuse it.

3) other misc problems that make it hard to work transparently (VMA alignment,
levels which you may or may not want to share, you need to revisit most page
table walkers in the kernel to get a completely transparent feature, etc)

mshare_mseal!

I think the core infrastructure is relatively generic (at least the
small core mm modifications to get this to even work) already, but
perhaps Anthony can comment on that.
