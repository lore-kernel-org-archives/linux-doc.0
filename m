For purposes of upstream. I'm not sure we care if a particular implementation
is useable with the feature set initially supported.  We just care if
there is a path to test the subset supported (hacks / emulation, whatever is fine).

Timestamp variety is complex. Fairly sure you are allowed to report no
timestamps at all as one option. If you pretend they all look like that
initially it might bring some simplifications. Anyhow, you know this
code better than I do, so maybe that is harder than I'm thinking.

I'd still push boot-on out for a follow on patch set.  Sure can
aim to land that one quickly! Sure customers will
get irritated by lack of support for what they have. Taking equivalent
of MPAM.  The initial support for that covered pretty much nothing on
real platforms. Customers were (and still are) irritated. But that
allowed progress in the right direction.

If we have to fallback to breaking it into steps that don't do much
more than print a message to say 'stuff found' then do that. It's ugly
but MPAM did that, RME is doing that. No one likes dead code, but it
does allow progress to be made.  Ideal is end to end with subset of
features then add features but not always achievable.

Normal rule of thumb for landing a feature is sub 2k lines of code
because that is about what a reviewer can digest in one go.

Very rare anything above 5k makes progress. As Sudeep mentioned, a
lot of folk will open the cover letter, see loc and close it again unread.
