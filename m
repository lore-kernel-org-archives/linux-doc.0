Sounds good!

FYI, many parts of DAMON are designed assuming it will be used on production
environments that have long-running workload and prefer stability.  It helps
making good results in long run, but also make it difficult to understand it in
short term, especially on lab environments.

I learned that by grateful users including you, and therefore recently
developed the multiple quota tuning logics and failed regions charge ratio.  I
feel like such DAMON limitation has contributed to this case to confuse you.
Sorry if that was the case, and please feel free to share your pain points and
improvement ideas.  Every user's use case including yours does matter!


Thanks,
SJ
