Document the delay_us option: the delay happens above the driver, a
delayed bio is not run through the rules again, and holding a bio back
reorders it against bios submitted later.

 ===================	=======================================================
 
+Delays
+------
+
+A delayed bio is held before it is submitted, so the device itself never sees a
+slow I/O: the delay is not visible to the driver, to the I/O statistics, or to
+anything else below submission such as writeback throttling.  Throttling by
+blk-throttle happens before a bio can be delayed, so it is not affected either.
+What it does exercise is everything waiting above the block layer, for instance
+io_uring cancellation, hung task detection, and filesystem or userspace
+timeouts.  Because the low level driver is not involved, a delay does not reach
+the blk-mq timeout handler or SCSI error handling.
+
+Once a bio has been delayed no rule is evaluated for it a second time, not when
+its delay expires and it is submitted below the injection hook, and not when
+the block layer splits it and resubmits the remainder above the hook.  A bio
+that matched a delay rule therefore never gets an error from another rule, even
+one covering the same sectors, and is held for the delay once rather than once
+per split.  Put the delay and the status in a single rule to fail a bio after
+holding it back.
+
+A delayed bio is issued after bios submitted while it was held, which reorders
+the I/O stream.  On zoned devices this breaks sequential write ordering: zone
+write plugging happens below the injection hook, so the writes issued while a
+write is held reach the zone out of order and are failed as misaligned.  Only
+delay reads there.
+
+Bios that must not block are never delayed.  A bio with REQ_NOWAIT set is
+submitted, or failed with the rule's status, immediately.
+
+The delay is a lower bound for anything longer than a timer tick, and the timer
+wheel adds further slack as the delay grows.  Values shorter than a tick are of
+little use: they expire on the next tick, which is anywhere between now and one
+tick away.
+
+Removing rules does not release bios that are already being delayed by them;
+those run out on their own.  A delayed bio whose disk is removed in the meantime
+is not submitted until its delay expires, by which point the queue no longer
+accepts I/O, so it fails with EIO.
