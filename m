OK, fair enough.  I don't know how RPMh works well enough to argue.
It does seem odd that you'd want to design things such that it takes a
few msecs to pull it out of runtime suspend, especially for touch.

OK, I'm fine with leaving something like this till later if/when it
comes up.  Documenting a little bit more about how these timings work
seems like it would be nice, though, at least mentioning what the
source clock is...

Does that 1-2 interrupts make any real difference, though?  In theory
it really shouldn't affect the transfer rate.  We should be able to
service the interrupt plenty fast and if we were concerned we would
tweak the watermark code a little bit.  So I guess we're worried about
the extra CPU cycles (and power cost) to service those extra couple
interrupts?

In theory when touch data is coming in or NFC data is coming in then
we're probably not in a super low power state to begin with.  If it's
touch data we likely want to have the CPU boosted a bunch to respond
to the user quickly.  If we've got 8 cores available all of which can
run at 1GHz or more a few interrupts won't kill us.  NFC data is
probably not common enough that we need to optimize power/CPU
utilizatoin for that.


So while i can believe that you do save an interrupt or two, I still
am not convinced that those interrupts are worth a bunch of complex
code (and a whole second code path) to save.


...also note that above you said that coming out of runtime suspend
can take several msec.  That seems like it dwarfs any slight
difference in timing between a FIFO-based operation and DMA.

Yeah, I certainly agree that the calls are needed if
pm_runtime_get_sync() and I'm not suggesting removing them.  Hence the
"as far as I can tell the whole sequence is right".

...but I'm actually kinda worried if you're saying that you actually
ran into this case.  Hopefully that got fixed and code no longer tries
to read from the PMIC at a bad time anymore?  That code should be
fixed not to be running so late in suspend.

Since this is weird (to me anyway), please document w/ a comment.

Still feels like this belongs in the i2c core, not your driver.  Maybe
you should send a patch for the core and remove it from here?

...and also, it seems like any i2c clients that don't implement the
suspend/resume callbacks and try to do i2c transactions late in the
game need to be fixed.  It should be documented that this isn't a
valid thing for a driver to do and if we end up in this error case
then it's not an i2c issue but it's a bad driver somewhere.

OK.  PM Runtime always gets me mixed up.  Seems really strange that it
wouldn't autosuspend all devices (regardless of timeout) at system
suspend time.
