I must admit the issues Chao raised were a clear oversight on my part.


I wrote some basic functionality unit tests in kernel selftests, which =
were included in v1 and v2.

Later I started to create FRED tests in kvm-unit-tests and extended one =
nested test case to CET:

https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/aJ9DB12YVJEyDORD@intel.com/

I planned to send out these new kvm unit tests (not just FRED tests) =
after KVM FRED patch series gets merged.
