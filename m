OK, thanks for the clarification. This confirms my initial suspicion but
it is better to have it clearly articulated. I can see several problems
with this approach. First and formost I do not think dealing with all
cmas this way is manageable. This can become a mess very quickly if we
have one limit per cma and too coarse if there is a single one. I also
have my doubts about space allocation control through a simple limit for
something that is effectively a reserved physical space.

I might be proven wrong but unless cma serves objects of a uniform
size then this will simply not work in practice. Hitting ENOSPC without
hitting limits and thus impractical for shared space management.

Correct. But those are a subject of migration so any such placement
should not be blocking real CMA allocations.

From the memcg POV we do account physically consumed memory. So yes,
it makes no difference where the memory comes from. We only care about
the overall capacity you can constrain or protect. Generally speaking it
makes sense to charge heavy memory consumers directly triggerable from
the userspace.

That is all memcg can provide you with. Specific requirements for
specific types of memory is a different story. We currently cannot
control per-numa node for example. There is an ongoing work to make
memcg memory tier aware.

Correct. Those are effectively a shared memory pools without any
control. I do not think memcg is a good method to enfore any usage
limits for that though for reasons mentioned above. Memcg is effective
at capping the overall memory consumption of a workload. Not really
great when it comes to a specific memory pool control.

Thanks. Yes this is more clear now. And it resembles hugetlb situation
more than memcg. You simply need a memory pool specific access and usage
control. Dispersing that to a global memcg limit seems rather coarse and 
I would say impractical. So it really calls for a per pool control with
an understanding of how the specific pool really works.
