No, use something that does not change, like filesystem labels or
serial numbers, or something else that is guaranteed unique.

Yes, paths can, and will, change.  Don't use them.

Why not use a UUID, that is explicitly what those are designed for.

It's not going to solve your problem, so I wouldn't worry about it.  And
you can't remove it, although I really would like to :)
