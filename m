One worry with a fixed N is that it's a magic number. If a machine has more
than N big holes (more sockets / NUMA nodes, or several CXL devices), the
extra ones are silently not excluded and get walked again.

And making N configurable just moves the per-machine tuning back to the
user, which is exactly what I'm trying to avoid.

vaddr over-includes the gaps into its regions too, but it can skip them
cheaply: it walks the VMA tree (find_vma / maple tree), it's cheap.
paddr has no such structure, so an included hole is walked in full.

That's why a fixed N is safe for vaddr but risky for paddr.

I'm not actually running DAMON_LRU_SORT or DAMON_RECLAIM on such a machine.
I ran into this while working on per-cgroup hot/cold page tracking, where I
was comparing performance and accuracy across setups — that's where these
numbers came from.

And to be clear, I'm not trying to land a patch here — I just noticed this
as a possible optimization. If you have a better idea, I'm happy to go with
it :).
