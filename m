We need to be really careful about claims and specifications.
Consider the following sequence of events (error checking ignored;
assume that it's there).

       unlink("foo");  // make sure the file "foo" doesn't exist
       unlink("bar");  // make sure the file "bar" doesn't exist
       fd = open("foo", O_CREAT|O_WRONLY);
       write(fd, "foo bar data", 12);
       fsync(fd);
       // if we crash here, the file "foo" will exist, and you will be able
       // to read 12 bytes, and it will be present
       link("foo", "bar");
       fdatasync(fd);
       // if we crash here, there is no guarantee that the hard link "bar"
       // will be persisted

I believe this is perfectly compliant with _POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO.

If the last fsyncdata(fd) is replaced with fsync(fd), the link(2) will
touch the ctime, so in order only to persist the ctime change, as a
side effect we will also update the directory entry so the existence
of "bar" will be persisted.

The bottom line, though, is I remain *very* skeptical about people who
want to document and then tie the hands of file system developers
about guarantees that go beyond Posix unless we have a very careful
discussion about what benefit this will provide application
developers, at least in general.  If application developers start
depending on behaviors beyond POSIX, it limits the ability of file
system developers to innovate in order to improve performance.

There may be cases where it's worth it, and there may be cases where
it's pretty clear that the laws of physics such that certain things
that go beyond POSIX will always be true.  But before we encourage
application developers to go beyond POSIX, we really should have this
conversation first.

For example, ext4 implements a guarantee that goes beyond POSIX, in
that if you create a file, say, "foo.new", and then you rename that
file such that it replaces an existing file, say "foo", then after the
rename system call, we will initiate asynchronous writeback on
"foo.new".  This is free if the application programmer has alrady
called fsync on "foo.new".  However, for an sloppy application which
doesn't bother to call fsync(2), for which Darrick informs me includes
"rpm", it saves you from lost files if you immediately reboot.

I do this, because there are tons of sloppy application programmers,
and so they outnumber file system developers.  However, this is not
documented behavior, nor is it guaranteed by POSIX!  I'm told by
Darrick that XFS doesn't do this, and he believes the XFS developers
would refuse to add such hacks, because it accomodates incompetent
userspace programmers.

Perhaps the right answer is to yell at the application programmers who
make these mistakes.  After all, the fact that ext4 accomodates
incompetence could be argued is leading to decreased application
quality and decreased portability.  But at least back in the O_PONIES
era, I looked at multiple text editors supplied by both GNOME and KDE,
and I discovered to my horror they were writing files in an extremely
unsafe manner.  (Some of them also were simply opening an existing
file with O_TRUNC, and then rewriting the text file's data, and NOT
bother calling fsync afterwards; so ext4 also has a hack so for files
opened with O_TRUNC where an existing file is truncated, on the close,
we will initiate writeback.  I chose this as being relatively low
overhead, because no competently implemented text editor should be
saving files in this way....)

Whether or not ext4 should accomodate application programmers by going
on POSIX, I believe very strongly that it should *not* be documented,
since it just encourages the bad application programming practice.
It's there just as a backstop, and in fact, it's done as an
asynchronous writeback, not as a data integrity writeback.  So it is
*not* something people should be relying on.

So before we document behavior that goes beyond POSIX, we should think
*very* carefully if this is something that we want to be encouraging
application programmers to rely on this sort of thing.
