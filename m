Hi Arnd,

We're actually passing 9 words here; 8 DATA words plus the LAUNCH word. CLA
supports only 64 bit aligned and sized accesses (other accesses are RAZ/WI) so
they have to be written as 9x64bit stores. Then poll using 64bit loads.

Good question. This is how the HW operates.

No, unfortunately not.

The STATUS register has a fault bit; the poller notices, reads fault info from
accelerator registers and takes actions to resolve the fault (which in practice
means access from user space on CPU and fault into the kernel to handle).

Yes; STATUS indicates READY while it can accept more asynchronous operations
("comamnds").

Yes; the driver manages assignment of a CLA to a process context completely
separately from the thread scheduler's decisions about which threads run on
which CPUs and when. If another process is scheduled onto the CPU and it
attempts to access it's VA for the CLA, it will fault into the driver's handler
and be put to sleep until the driver decides to reassign the CLA.

I'm not sure what you mean by "Which instruction specifically causes the fault".
A fault occurs within the accelerator if it tries to access a virtual address
that is not mapped by the page table or if the permissions of the mapping are
not sufficient, etc... The fact that the accelerator has faulted is reported to
the SW that is polling the accelerator's STATUS register within user space. That
SW is expected to trigger fault handling by the usual kernel mechanisms by
accessing the VA. Then it issues a RESOLVE operation to tell the accelerator it
can continue.

I can't currently share that information. I expect you might be able to have a
good guess though :)

Yes, correct. User space threads don't need to be precisesly synchronized
because multiple operations can be queued.

Yes indeed. As I said, Arm plans to open source a user space driver, but there
is no commitment on dates yet.

As per cover letter: "the initial (and currently only) target is a compute
engine". There are not any plans for crypto accelerators (or other things like
that). So haven't been considering this as something the kernel would want to
use directly.

(Sorry I'm being vague - I'm sure you appreciate I'm limited on what I can say
around the use cases for now).

The driver maintains a cla_ctx for each {file description, mm_struct} pair. So
in this case, even though the file description is shared between the parent and
child processes, they still have distinct mm_structs so still have separate
contexts allowing the driver to virtualize access correctly.

Yes, at it's simplest. But it gets a bit complicated if you introduce the idea
of a priority to each cla_ctx. If a high priority context needs the HW
periodically and preempts a low priority context, if we just abort the low
priority work on preemption, it may never make forward progress. We've been
considering a grace period where the kernel will wait for the accelerators to
complete their current work (up to a certain timeout) before reassigning them to
the incomming context. But none of that is part of this RFC - I think that's
discussion that can come later once we have the basic shape of everything agreed.

Thanks,
Ryan
