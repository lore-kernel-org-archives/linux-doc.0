I see no problem with having a per-accelerator VM area for MMIO
operations mapped to userspace, this is obviously part of all
designs like this one that sneak custom coprocessor instructions
in by disguising them as MMIO.

My concern is about how userspace gets to that mapping, both
the chardev itself, but also the ioctls.

Without concrete implementation examples, I find it hard to imagine
how granular the CLA and accelerator blocks are. What I'm interested
in is separating things into special character devices when they
refer to units that you want to manage separately in userspace.

If you have e.g. one accelerator for tensor operations and one for
handling gzip, I would very much want to see those have a separate
chardev nodes so a local administrator can give permissions to each
one separately, and have device names that are sensible to the
functionality underneath.

If you have separate accelerators for AES encryption and decryption,
or a large set of identical accelerators that can run concurrently,
those would of course get managed as a single device file.

Most importantly, I don't think a global /dev/cla device node
is a sensible interface from a management perspective as that
would give unprivileged userspace direct control to something
that is essentially arbitrary (or buggy) vendor firmware
with DMA permissions.

Got it, thanks

Sorry, I think we have a clash of terminology. I meant whether
a CPU can start multiple operations on one or more accelerator
in a single cla_domain, and have each of those operate at the
same time while the hardware is asynchronously processing them
in parallel.

It sounds like a single accelerator has one register to wait for
completion and can only have single operation in progress at any
time, but if multiple accelerators are in the same cla_ctx,
can a single thread start an operation in each one before waiting
for the first to complete?

I need to think about it more. Probably not a DoS, but if the resource
is managed like CPU timeslices, I wonder whether you'd have to also
consider things like realtime tasks or priority inversion.

Ok, makes sense.
