Thanks for the detailed comments.

I agree that improving the default proactive/async reclaim behavior can
be useful, and I also agree that tiered memcg counters/limits would be
useful. I do not see source=nodes as a replacement for those directions.
They solve different parts of the problem: tiered counters/limits provide
accounting and policy targets, while source=nodes is only an actuator for
proactive reclaim.

So I think these directions are compatible. A better default reclaim
policy or tiered memcg limits can improve kernel-driven behavior, while
source=nodes gives userspace an explicit way to apply reclaim pressure
to a selected resident source.

That is fair, and I do not intend this to avoid improving reclaim or
adding better tier-aware memcg accounting. A better memory.reclaim
algorithm would also make source=nodes more useful, because source=nodes
still uses the existing reclaim path after selecting the resident source.
The goal here is narrower: expose a source-scoped proactive reclaim
actuator while keeping the kernel's reclaim policy in control. The old
nodes= discussion had ABI problems, but it also showed that a
nodemask-like source selector is a useful primitive for finer-grained
proactive reclaim control [1].

This is a good example of why source=nodes should not be described as a
one-shot net footprint guarantee. Assuming source=nodes:1, the request
applies reclaim pressure to memcg memory resident on node1. That may
free some space on node1 in the short term, which can provide room for a
later node0-to-node1 demotion step. If zswap allocation, kswapd, or memcg
reclaim later moves pressure back across tiers and node1 usage rises
again, that is part of the dynamic reclaim/tiering behavior.

So userspace cannot rely on one write to memory.reclaim to produce a
final per-node distribution. The intended usage is a feedback loop: the
controller observes the memcg's resident distribution, chooses the source
nodes it wants to relieve, applies source-scoped reclaim pressure,
observes the new distribution, and iterates.

I do not think this patch should make source=nodes constrain zswap pool
allocations. That would be a different and much stronger semantic. The
current intent is only to constrain the resident source from which memcg
reclaim applies pressure, while completion accounting remains the
existing memory.reclaim accounting.

Agreed. I will update the cover letter to make this model clearer. I
will also make clear that source=nodes is not a final net per-node
footprint guarantee and does not change memory.reclaim completion
accounting.
