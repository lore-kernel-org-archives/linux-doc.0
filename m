I've read half of the next patch that adds the isolation thing. And
while that kludges around the whole root cgorup is magic thing, it
doesn't help if you move the above scenario on level down:


	R
     /    \
   A        B
          /   \
        C       D


R: cpus=0-7, load_balance=0
A: cpus=0-1, load_balance=1
B: cpus=2-7, load_balance=0
C: cpus=2-3, load_balance=1
D: cpus=4-7, load_balance=1


Also, I feel we should strive to have a minimal amount of tasks that
cannot be moved out of the root group; the current set is far too large.
