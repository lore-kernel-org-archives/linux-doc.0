I had imagined a slightly wider focus, but this seems OK for now.  We can
always rename it later :)

I do wonder if, rather than creating a new directory, we shouldn't just
make a single acpi.rst and put that information into it?

...and something similar here?  I guess that would be my preference, but I
don't feel all that strongly about it if there's reasons to do otherwise.

In general the plan seems good.
