Doing it this way would have been my first incliniation.  It would
avoid all the oddities of the kernel magically creating a VMA when
clone() is called, guessing the shadow stack size, etc.  But I'm okay
with having the kernel do it automatically, too.  I think it would be
very nice to have a way for user code to find out the size of the
shadow stack and change it, though.  (And relocate it, but maybe
that's impossible.  The CET documentation doesn't have a clear
description of the shadow stack layout.)

True.  I proposed in a different email that ptrace() have full control
of the shadow stack (read, write, lock, unlock, etc).

Dunno.  But given that MPX seems to be dying, I'm not sure it matters.
