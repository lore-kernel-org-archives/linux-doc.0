I was imagining an API like "allocate a shadow stack for the current
thread, fail if the current thread already has one, and turn on the
shadow stack".  glibc would call clone and then call this ABI pretty
much immediately (i.e. before making any calls from which it expects
to return).

We definitely want strong enough user control that tools like CRIU can
continue to work.  I haven't looked at the SDM recently enough to
remember for sure, but I'm reasonably confident that user code can
learn the address of its own shadow stack.  If nothing else, CRIU
needs to be able to restore from a context where there's a signal on
the stack and the signal frame contains a shadow stack pointer.

Only if the trampoline works if the shadow stack is already enabled.

I could very easily be convinced that automatic shadow stack setup is
a good idea, but I still think we need manual control for CRIU and
such.
