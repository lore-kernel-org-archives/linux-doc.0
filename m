Jonathan, given this touches Documentation/Makefile, could you ACK if
it looks good to you? Noticed both patches don't have doc: $subj prefix,
but that's something we could fix up.

Maybe one small request, would be nice to build Documentation/bpf/libbpf/
also with every BPF CI run to avoid breakage of program_types.csv. Donald
could you check if feasible? Follow-up might be ok too, but up to Andrii.

Thanks,
Daniel
