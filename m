FIFO mode gives us 2 advantages:
1. small transfers don't have to go through 'dma-map/unmap penalties.
Some small buffers come from the stack of client caller and the
dma-map/unmap may fail.
2. bring-ups are 'less eventful' (with temp. change to just not have DMA
mode at all during bring-ups) since SMMU translation/DMA path from QUP
(master) to memory slave may not always available when critical I2C
peripherals need to be brought up (e.g. PMIC). CPU to QUP (slave) path
is usually available.

On the other side, DMA mode has other advantages:
1. Multiple android clients are still heavily using I2C in spite of
faster peripheral buses being available in industry.
As an example, some multi-finger Touch screens use I2C and the data to
be transferred per transaction over the bus grows well beyond 70-100
bytes based on number of fingers. These transactions are very frequent
when touch is being used, and in an environment where other heavy system
users are also running (MM/graphics).
Another example is, NFC uses I2C (as of now) to transfer as much as 700+
bytes. This can save us 20+ interrupts per transfer.

These transfers are mostly in burst. So the RPMh penalty to resume the
shared resources is only experienced for very first transfer. Remaining
transfers in the burst benefit from DMA if they are too big.

Goal here is to have common driver for upstream targets and android and
android has seen proven advantages with both modes.
If we end up keeping DMA only for downstream (or FIFO only for
downstream), then we lose the advantage of having code in upstream since
we have to maintain downstream patch with other mode.
