Well to state the obvious: the reason it does all that is to make the
compression space transparent to the user.

The user can answer a simple boolean question: whether they want
compression or not. And it will work on tiny machines, on humongous
machines, and everything in between. That's a simple policy question
with a clear answer.

What you're doing, asking the user for a static size, is much more
difficult and has usability issues.

You're comparing implementations that don't accomplish the same thing.

The problem we're trying to solve is implementing a clean compression
space abstraction. I'm arguing that vswap does, and xswap does not.

While they're both using parts of the swap device code to implement a
compression space, xswap actually PRESENTS IT TO THE USER as a swap
device, and then makes optimizations BASED ON BAKED IN LIMITATIONS.

But a conventional, statically sized swap device is a bad abstraction
for the compression space. Here is why:

In conventional swap space, one memory page translates to one swap
page. Compression space doesn't act this way: a memory page can
consume anything between a few bytes to a full page in compression
space. It depends on memory contents and compression algorithm. So
right off the bat, this is a hard question to answer at the host level
which could run all kinds of workloads.

In conventional swap space, the resource consumed is a different
one. You're offloading memory by consuming disk space. This eats into
the space available to the filesystem, which is totally unrelated.
Asking the user for this tradeoff is a legitimate policy question.

Compression space is not a separate resource. It's page tables,
backing pages, and swap descriptors. It's just MEMORY. There isn't a
size tradeoff, because moving pages from memory space into compression
space DOES NOT CONSUME A NEW RESOURCE. It's still just memory. All you
need for containment already exists: rlimits, OOM killer, cgroup
memory controls.

By making this a user-visible virtual swap device, you're sending
users down the wrong path. You're asking them to set a new limit on a
resource that's already limited by other means. You're framing the
question as conventional swap which behaves completely differently.

If you ask them "how much swap space", they WILL reference this to
available RAM capacity. Maybe half of ram, maybe twice the RAM.

But when compression space is referenced to RAM, it's trivial to fill
it up with zeroed pages or easily compressible data LONG BEFORE the
process or container would hit any of its MEMORY limits.

This creates an artificial resource shortages. It forces a competition
where there shouldn't be one. And then you need new controls to manage
a competition that doesn't have to exist.

Like I said before, including compression space (which is memory) in
memory.swap.* (which is for disk space) is not going to be acceptable
from the cgroup side. We can talk about that if you want.

But asking the user questions they shouldn't have to answer, or
already answered elsewhere, is weak interface design. Allowing, let
alone encouraging, answers that create a whole new host of
organizational issues is outright bad interface design.

So if you want to compare implementations, you first have to actually
implement the same thing:

Stop asking user "how large". Let compression space expand towards
existing memory limits, such that it doesn't create an awkward and
artificial new resource competition.

Then we can compare implementations.

If the optimizations still apply under those constraints, great.

Until then, there is little point in discussing differences that, by
your own admission, have little to no impact on real world performance.
