Something to consider is that certain side effects of what fsync(2) or
fdatasync(2) might drag into the jbd2 transaction might change if we
were to implement (for example) something like Daejun Park and Dongkun
Shin's "iJournaling: Fine-grained journaling for improving the latency
of fsync system call" published in Usenix, ATC 2017:

   https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc17/atc17-park.pdf

That's an example of how if we document synchronization that goes
beyond POSIX, it might change in the future.  So if it gets
documented, applications might start becoming unreliable on FreeBSD,
MacOS, etc.  And maybe as Linux developers we won't care about that;
since it increases Linux lock-in.  Win!  (If you think like Steve
Ballmer, anyway.  :-)

But then if we were to implement something like incremental journaling
for fsync, and applications were to start assuming that it would also
work, application authors might complain that we had broken their
application So they might call the new feature a *BUG* which broke
backwards compatibility, and then demand that we either withdraw the
new feature, or complicate our testing matrix by adding Yet Another
Mount Option.  (That's especially true since iJournaling is a
performance improvement that doesn't require an on-disk format change.
So this is the sort of thing that we might want to enable by default
eventually, even if initially it's only enabled via a mount option
while we are stablizing the new feature.)

So my concerns are not a theoretical, abstract concern, but something
which is very real.  Implementing something like what Park and Shin
has proposed is something that is very much that we are thinking
about.
