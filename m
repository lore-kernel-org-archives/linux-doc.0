Hi Will,

Thanks for the quick reply!

JP and I had a quick glance at the Sashiko feedback; looks like some useful
stuff, and a few false alarms. Nothing cricial though. Not that it matters too
much for this stage of discussion.

Understood. Now that I have such a clear statement, hopefully I can use that to
work internally to get commitments and dates to build a proper plan. What I'm
trying to get out of this RFC though, is "is having an open source user space
the main blocker, or are there other significant challenges here too?".

They both exist internally of course. There is a plan to publish the spec, but I
don't think we will converge on a timeframe until after the summer now. I'll
follow up regarding fastmodel.

The virtualization implementation is not as advanced as bare-metal and JP can
probably comment on it in more detail, but the intention is to expose the HW
using VFIO-MDEV (mediated device framework). We will need exported functions
from (the arm64 part of) KVM to grab the S2 pgdir and to get/put the VMID - we
would not be using MMU notifiers but instead sharing the pgtable and VMID and
piggybacking the CPU's TBLI operations. My current expectation is that it can be
made to work without deep KVM integration and still as a module, but let's see
where we get to with the code. (I have spoken with Marc about this briefly - I
would say he doesn't love it, but agreed to look at the code when we have it).

But I think I'm hearing that to get into a deeper discussion we will need to
post virt support? In which case, I'll prioritise getting something together.
I'm about to be on sabbatical for 4 weeks though, so probably won't be until
~early Sept.

Thanks,
Ryan
