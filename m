If you mean by this adding a bit more of pad/reserved space scattered
here and there, it is not a problem; also, one thing that is still missing
and planned to be added is some ABI Versioning and related IOCTL,
should not this be enough to address future possible UAPI expansions ?

Regarding avoiding mapping internal SCMI object in the UAPI, I think I
am already NOT blindly sharing internal structures but instead I copy
explicitly internal representations into the UAPI fields....I think the
only exception to this is the sample (scmi_tlm_de_sample) that I take
care to keep aligned with the internals to avoid the overhead of the
double copy...but it seems one of the few pretty much general concept
that I felt confident to abstract no ?

...but of course this UAPI abstraction into which I copy the results
is mapped into SCMI inspired concepts/abstractions...for the reasons
we said....

Not sure what you mean here... a shim layer used to acces info data
indirectly instead of the SCMI data structures ?

or some sort of layer/abstraction to be able to remap references
internally ? again it is not easy to imagine an abstraction without any
other example than SCMI...or you mean naming issue in the UAPI ?

well..if you refer to the telemetry_ops, this is an SCMI driver so it
has the structure of an SCMI driver, the Telemetry Operations exposed by
the core SCMI stack are the internal ops themselves that you ask for in
my opinion...I mean this is pretty much internal stuff that has nothing
to do with the UAPI itself and I imagine that when some future protocol
of yours, like the XXMI you mentioned, will appear you will write a new
driver on your own subsystem that will implement the UAPI itself for
your protocols (if you want to share that)...any possible future internal
reworking due to possible common abstractions on our side can be carried
out in the future...

Completely agreed on this...Documentation is still lacking, including
extensive examples...I should have marked docs as RFC too...

Yes it will be documented too...in one of the future series.

No problem for UAPI growth and possible compatibility visa reserved
space and ABI versioning, but I dont see how a very susbsystem specific
driver like this SCMI Telemetry driver can be made more generic in terms of
provider/backend...the provider here is indeed already separated by the usage
of the SCMI telemetry protocol operations exposed by the core SCMI stack...

I think in order to have multiple backend providers pluggable/interchangeable
at will without the need to write a new driver for ecah one would mean, again,
having some sort common framework...thing that seems premature, as agreed.

Thanks,
Cristian
