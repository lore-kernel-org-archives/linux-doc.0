I'm not sure I really see anything this events file provides that analysis of current usage and set limits doesn't? If your usage is highly variable, the separately-developed dmem.peak file might also suit your needs, but still, not sure what you can do with dmem.events that you can't already do with these tools.

Agreed, they're separate but both useful.

The peak tells you what the maximum memory consumption is.
The events are sent when a limit is reached, but more will also count how often limit is reached and reclaim needs to happen.

So if you have 4 cgroups, and 1 of them sends a lot of events, that tells you that you may want
to increase that cgroup's limits dynamically to have a more performant system.

Kind regards,
