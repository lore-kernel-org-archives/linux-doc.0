We can.  But it is bit cumbersome to opening web browser and moving my focus to
there.  Reading everything on the mailing tool is easier for some people like
me.  Like some test bots send reports are replying to patches, or we sometimes
forwarding bugzilla reports to mailing lists in a form of a plain text mail.

Secondly, I have to share my opinions about the reviews, as many times AI
reviews need human's opinions.  There is no good way to do that on the web ui
of the tool (sashiko) for now, and I think this mail based flow is the best.

And anyway I'm supposed to share at least my review of AI reviews, in mm
community.  If I ignore, I will only make Andrew have to reply asking that.

I used to share only my review of the AI reviews as replies, instead of
forwarding AI reviews and then replies to those.  But it was
1. cumbersome for me (should summarize AI review and then my review; feeling
   doing work twice), and
2. feeling not optimal at sharing all concerning comments with others.  My
   summary might miss some points of AI review but other reviewers might just
   believe me and don't read the full review due to the additional web browser
   opening work.  Also some other reivewers might kindly review AI reviews
   before I do, and save my (or their) time.

Hence I ended up to do this bit odd workflow:  Forwarding the full AI review on
the mailing list first, then reply my responses.

> sending it back to all of us feels odd,

If this is polluting your inbox and/or distract you, I'm so sorry for that.
Please let me know if this is distracting you.  Maybe I can filtering people
who don't want this kind of replies out of the recipients for the forwarding
mails.  Or, if you have a suggestion about what need to be changed, please let
me know.

> especially when it is your own patches.

Unfortuantely sashiko cannot send email on its own (yet).  So I'm doing that
until it can.

I hope my above explanation helps you.
