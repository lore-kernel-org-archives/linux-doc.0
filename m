I wonder whether we need all this guarding. In the worst case, we could
rewrite the function, something like below, to always unregister and
only warn:

void arch_unregister_cpu(int cpu)
{
	acpi_handle acpi_handle = acpi_get_processor_handle(cpu);
	struct cpu *c = &per_cpu(cpu_devices, cpu);
	acpi_status status;
	unsigned long long sta;

	if (!acpi_handle) {
		pr_err_once("Removing a CPU without associated ACPI handle\n");
	} else {
		status = acpi_evaluate_integer(acpi_handle, "_STA", NULL, &sta);
		if (!ACPI_FAILURE(status) &&
		    cpu_present(cpu) && !(sta & ACPI_STA_DEVICE_PRESENT))
			pr_err_once("Changing CPU present bit is not supported\n");
	}

	unregister_cpu(c);
}

However, on the first condition, can we actually trigger !acpi_handle?
If not, we could just drop it. I tried to look up the paths and I don't
think we'd ever end up in this function with !acpi_handle. So this
leaves us with the next checks.

On the second/third conditions, it's more about preventing physical CPU
hotplug as we haven't properly defined it for arm yet but we could just
add a WARN_ONCE() to make it more visible and still proceed with the
unregistering. I think with your proposal, we don't fully unroll the
state anyway just by returning an error in arch_unregister_cpu(), so I'd
rather continue here.

What does firmware do for virtual CPU hotplug w.r.t. _STA? I noticed a
slight change in wording in the cpu-hotplug.rst doc with your patch from

  On virtual systems the _STA method must always report the CPU as
  ``present``

to

  On virtual systems the _STA method must report the CPU as ``present``
  when it is activated by the firmware

Was your intention that _STA.PRESENT can become 0 when hot-unplugging
virtual CPUs?
