Subject: [PATCH v3] Docs/admin-guide/cgroup-v2: document io.latency rotational vs non-rotational behavior

From: Tao Cui <cuitao@kylinos.cn>

io.latency is documented only in terms of average latency and the avg_lat
stat, which matches rotational devices.  On non-rotational devices a group
misses its target when 10% or more of the IOs in the window individually
exceed it, and io.stat reports missed/total rather than avg_lat/win.

Describe both cases: how a miss is detected, note that the avg_lat tuning
guidance is rotational-only, and update the io.stat field list (mark
avg_lat/win as rotational-only, document missed/total).

Acked-by: Michal Koutný <mkoutny@suse.com>
Signed-off-by: Tao Cui <cuitao@kylinos.cn>

Changes in v3:
- Move the missing-target note to the missed field and avoid naming the
  exact threshold there (Michal Koutný).
- Add Acked-by from Michal Koutný.

 Generally you do not want to set a value lower than the latency your device

 Start at higher than the expected latency for your device and, with
