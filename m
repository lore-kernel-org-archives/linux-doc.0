Subject: [PATCH v4] Docs/admin-guide/cgroup-v2: document io.latency rotational vs non-rotational behavior

From: Tao Cui <cuitao@kylinos.cn>

io.latency is documented only in terms of average latency and the avg_lat
stat, which matches rotational devices.  On non-rotational devices a group
misses its target once enough of the IOs in the window individually exceed
it, and io.stat reports missed/total rather than avg_lat/win.

Describe both cases: how a miss is detected, note that the avg_lat tuning
guidance is rotational-only, and update the io.stat field list (mark
avg_lat/win as rotational-only, document missed/total).

Acked-by: Michal Koutný <mkoutny@suse.com>
Signed-off-by: Tao Cui <cuitao@kylinos.cn>

Changes in v4:
- Also drop the exact threshold value from the intro paragraph, so the
  documentation does not bind to it anywhere.  This fully matches Michal's
  "would not bind to the exact value in the docs"; v3 had only removed it
  from the field list.  Michal's Acked-by is retained.

Changes in v3:
- Move the missing-target note to the missed field and avoid naming the
  exact threshold there (Michal Koutný).
- Add Acked-by from Michal Koutný.

V3: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260718020759.2272551-1-cui.tao@linux.dev
