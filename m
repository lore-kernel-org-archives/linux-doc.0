The traditional name for this is a partition.

This is a significant departure from existing behaviour, but one I can
appreciate. I don't immediately see something terribly wrong with it.

I would be conservative and only allow 0/1.

Ah, so initially I was confused by the requirement for root to have it
always set, but you'll allow child domains to steal _all_ CPUs, such
that root ends up with an empty effective set?

What about the (kernel) threads that cannot be moved out of the root
group?

Right.

This I'm not clear on. Why?
