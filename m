I'm not sure what the problem is for windows :)

But if you want a chunk of contiguos memory that windows
does not poke at without a driver, virtio mem is that :)

I get this part. But we can absolutely make it static.


Let's start by replicating your functionality with virtio-iommu.  So:

-device is behind virtio-iommu
-virtio-iommu tells guest "this device can only consume memory from that range,"
-and maybe: ...and translation is 1:1 with this offset

if guest does not acknowledge it will just fail?


this covers the proposal here simply by using a dedicated range
per device, right?



But look what we can easily add later: share a range
between devices, now you can move data between them with zero copies.


Isn't that better?

Yes this is what I thought originally, that you intend to
do it in hardware. But re-reading it, it begins to look like
that's not really the case, it's only "theoretically possible"?
