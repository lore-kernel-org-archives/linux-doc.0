Alright.

Their register areas are mostly separate, although contiguous. On the=20
other
hand, the watchdog and OST can be started/stopped from a bit within a=20
TCU
register, so they're probably part of the same h/w block.

The idea is not to have necesarily one node per driver. I just wanted=20
to keep
it simple.
