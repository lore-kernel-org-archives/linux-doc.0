Hi, Dave,

Not really. I don't even know what kind of measurements can be used to
obtain this estimate. But Pixel 2 kernel with these patches + Android
runtime instrumented with HWASan works.

As I understand your main concern is userspace/kernel ABI changes
these patches introduce. This concern was already pointed out by
Catalin, and working out the details is still in progress.

I don't have a single link, I would suggest to look at the comments
for all the previous versions of this patchset. I see you saw the
pathset by Vincenzo, it also has some information about this.
