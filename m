What is a "metadata barrier" and what are it's semantics supposed to
be?

That's not sparse, that is an empty file or "contains no data".
"Sparse" means the file has "sparse data" - the data in the file is
separated by holes. A file that is just a single hole does not
contain "sparse data", it contains no data at all.

IOWs, if you mean "file has no data in it", then say that as it is a
clear and unambiguous statement of what the file contains.

Ambiguous. "recovery" is something filesystems do to bring the
filesystem into a consistent state after a crash. If you are talking
about applicaiton level behaviour, then you need to make that
explicit.

i.e. I can /assume/ you are talking about application level recovery
from your previous statement, but that assumption is obviously wrong
if the application is using O_TMPFILE and linkat rather than rename,
in which case it will be fileystem level recovery that is doing the
cleanup. Ambiguous, yes?

Perhaps, but I am not clear on exactly what you are proposing
because I don't know what the hell a "metadata barrier" is, what it
does or what it implies for filesystem integrity operations...

With words that I can only guess the meaning of.

Amir, if you are asking a complex question as to whether something
conforms to a specification, then please slow down and take the time
to define all the terms, the initial state, the observable behaviour
that you expect to see, etc in clear, unambiguous and well defined
terms.  Otherwise the question cannot be answered....

Cheers,

Dave.
