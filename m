This is obvious. That's the reason LOOKUP already returns a generation.

You phrased the question correctly, but the same question
applies to any other command, i.e.
"What are you asked to OPEN/TRUNCATE _on_?"

So you see, what's needed is to change the input argument
of ALL the fuse requests from nodeid to nodeid+generation, or
in the more generic form of NFS handles, a variable size object id blob.

This is from the latest proposal for FUSEX protocol [3]

struct fusex_id {
    u64 nodeid;
    /* will extend with file handle */
};

OK, so you are implementing a passthrough filesystem (to HDD)
with a fast caching layer, I assume to cache results of GETATTR/
LOOKUP/READDIR/READDIRPLUS? Anything else?
Are you caching a specific type of backing filesystem?

I advise you to look at libfuse_passthrough [1].
You can either see if it fits you or learn from my experience with NFS
export of a fuse passthrough filesystem.
I am giving a talk on the subject in Linux Plumbers next week [4].

The problem is, that what you assume is not an API definition, this is
a specific
filesystem implementation, which happens to be correct for some commonly
used filesystems (e.g. ext4, xfs), but is not true in general.
In general the API {name_to,open_by}_handle_at() the file handle is an
opaque blob.

The way that libfuse_passthrough gates against recycled inode numbers
is that the file handle is stored in the server's inode table at lookup tim=
e
(generation is recorded) and all the commands that follow, lookup in the
server's inode table (could be in sqlite in your case) and use
open_by_handle_at() with the recorded file handle from lookup time
to get an O_PATH fd to the object on the backing filesystem (on HDD).

This is called InodeRef in libfuse_passthrough and any request will return
ESTALE to the kernel if it cannot get an InodeRef.

Thanks,
Amir.
