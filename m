Yes and no.  If the payload didn't literally have all the assets needed to =
set
the kvmclock fields, then I wouldn't care.  But I don't think I'd be the on=
ly
person to see a GET+SET pair and expect GET to return exactly what was writ=
ten
via SET.

Only if userspace holds it just so.

Again, if and only if the fields match what has been written previoiusly.  =
To
me, that's not a SET operation given the full inputs.

I completely agree that conceptually this is intended to SET the entire clo=
ck,
but as you note above, reality doesn't allow for that.

Sorry, I didn't mean to imply there would be delay on the SET side.  What I=
 was
trying to say is that if this were punted to userspace, then there _would_ =
be a
ton of slop because it would be practically impossible for userspace to pro=
vide
the correct offset. (I was walking myself through why KVM needed to provide=
 uAPI
to compute the offset, as opposed to provide uAPI to let userspace jam in w=
hatever
value it wanted).
