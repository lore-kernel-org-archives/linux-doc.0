I am offering these as ways to move forward with vswap. There is
always the alternaive to use xswap instead.

I'd like to hear more about this. If a user wants to shoot themselves
in the foot. My philosophy is just let them. It is not worthwhile to
complicate the code path. We can add a big fat warning that
"Oh, you are configuring xswap with a priority other than the
recommended one." But if the user really wants to do it, we should
allow it.

Another use case is when users employ more than one swap device to
reduce swap device lock contention. It is not a big deal when you swap
out a few GB of memory. But if you swap out more than 100G of memory,
the swap device lock contention really shows up in the earlier version
of the swap core. The new swap allocator and swap table significantly
reduce that contention. But that contention still exists. A few
hundred G of memory under one lock is just a bit too much. I think
there is a legitimate reason to use more than one device to reduce
lock contention.

Granted, other ways exist to reduce lock contention, but they increase
code complexity as well. The current swap device design is a good
balance of code complexity and flexibility.

Points taken; this isn't enough to justify the extra maintenance and
complexity of vswap right now. A cleaner alternative exists with less
complexity overhead.
