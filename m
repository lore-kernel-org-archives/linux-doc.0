I do agree with Greg that it's all a bit excessive.  Thanks for your
your diligence, but perhaps dial it back a bit?  It's OK - we're all
trying to figure out how best to utilize this tool.

I view Sashiko as primarily an author tool.  Sometimes I call it
checkpatch++.  In a better world, author would be able to sort out
Sashiko issues before ever sending out the patchset.  But in this
world, a public send is needed to obtain that review.

So what we're presently seeing is author development activity which is
unfortunately and inappropriately being conducted on a public list.

Personally, I pay only a little attention to author's Sashiko activity.
Just enough to see whether I should pay more attention.  If author
says "oops, let me redo" then fine, I'll await the next spin.  If
author says "that was all nonsense" then fine, time to take a closer
look.
