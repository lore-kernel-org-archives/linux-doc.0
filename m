From: Tao Cui <cuitao@kylinos.cn>

io.latency is documented only in terms of average latency and the avg_lat
stat, which matches rotational devices.  On non-rotational devices a group
misses its target when 10% or more of the IOs in the window individually
exceed it, and io.stat reports missed/total rather than avg_lat/win.

Describe both cases: how a miss is detected, note that the avg_lat tuning
guidance is rotational-only, and update the io.stat field list (mark
avg_lat/win as rotational-only, document missed/total).
