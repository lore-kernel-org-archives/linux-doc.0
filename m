They are a general concern.  It is worth checking to see if the
performance of the proc file you modify changes measurably.

Another proc file.  It is more that we have gotten requests for that
in the past.

I will toss out one more possibility that seems like a good solution
with existing facilities.  Have the coredump helper (aka the process
that coredumps are piped to) read the signal state from the coredump.
At which point the coredump helper can back channel to init or whatever
needs this information.

I am probably missing something obvious but the consumer of all
coredumps seems like the right place to add functionality for debugging
like this as it can tell everything about the dead userspace process.
