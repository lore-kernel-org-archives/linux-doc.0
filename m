Thank you for clarifying, Ravi.

Why would the user have that large amount of headroom?

I agree there could be reasonable amount of free memory.  But, I'm still not
feeling difficult to know would that be big enough to cause the issue in DAMOS.

I think your arguments make sense in general.  But I'm still not quite sure
what is the realistic size of the problem, so difficult to judge.  Having a
clearer and detailed use case and backing data would be nice.

I also got a little and trivial concern for this approach.  DAMOS quota system
assumes the cost of applying DAMOS action will be proportional to the size of
memory it is applied for.  After this patch is applied, the cost will depend on
amount of free or offline memory in the memory.  It might make users difficult
to predict the overhead of DAMOS.  I might be too picky and hallucinated, but
to be honest I'm not feeling 100% comfortable with this change.

For long term, we are working on extending DAMON for general data attributes
monitoring.  I pretty sure you also aware of that.  The v1 [1] is just added to
mm-new for more testing.  It is currently supporting anon page and belinging
memory cgroup attributes.  I'm planning to extend that a lot.  In future, DAMOS
might be able to target and filter memory based on the attributes monitoring
results.  Then, we may be able to extend it for monitoring online or freeness
of the memory and ask DAMOS to filter out or de-prioritize memory regions
having high proportion of free or offline memory.

So, long story short, I'd suggest to revisit this after a clear use case and
real problem is found, unless we have it right now.
