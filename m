So, in the early episodes of this Telemetry 'saga' when it still was an
RFC [1] in which I was exploring/experimenting/evaluating different approaches
I DID mention that one possible evolutions of whatever interface would have been
used (SysFS vs chardev vs FileSystem) could have been:

"D. generalize enough one of the above choices to make it abstract enough        
   that other non-SCMI based telemetry can plug into some sort of geenric       
   Telemetry subsystem"

...BUT the reality check that immediately stopped this possibility onto
his tracks for me was the fact that at that time, like now, there was/is
ONLY the SCMI protocol acting as a possible Telemetry provider so that would
have meant:

 1. limited real use case examples to use to build a common Telemetry abstraction
    resulting most probably in a 'generic' common framework heavily
    biased toward SCMI mechanisms...for the simple fact that only SCMI really
    existed that provided such broad range of generic telemetry data....

 2. sure rejection from upstream, having created a supposedly generic common
    framework, sadly used by....just ONLY one user

These concerns came on top of the basic main fact that, as David pointed out,
a fully generic and common abstraction of Telemetry concepts is hard...

...it definitely seems easy at first by looking at some basic simple
common ideas, but it quickly becomes very challenging to represent in a
common way very speficic bits like, as an example, topology, grouping
etc etc ...and again especially when you have ONLY one user of this new
abstraction to look at for inspiration ...

Well here you are mentioning the SCMI internal API as exposed by the SCMI
core in include/linux/scmi_protocol.h and used by SCMI drivers to build
on top of the common protocol layer...of course it is SCMI specific,
always will be, even when/if a common Telemetry framework would exist.

I could agree on this...IF any of this would have a chance to exist now
with the current existing Telemetry providers...thing that seems not
plausible for the reasons above....

Yes some of these are theoretically possible, but NOT really in the only 
example we have so far that is SCMI....

I would also prefer to expose only kernel mediated Telemetry data to
avoid fragmentation (even within the same protocol when implemented by
different vendors...), BUT RAW access I am afraid is inevitable to be
able to write high-perf tools, and those will have necessarily to be
protocol/backend specific...

...which leads straight to the other point raised by David...

...Is really a common Telemetry UAPI needed ?

...if anyway multiple protocols would dictate multiple custom tools
probably not...

Yes this has defintely to be documented better...but..

..this is something again very much protocol specific, that evidentiates
once more that a common ABI to rule them all is not probably the way...

...in SCMI the platform firmware is the ultimate arbiter, it is in charge
of any kind of policying...it can cope even with the most unreasonable
asks coming from the agents, even come from root privileged users...

...simply because those requests will get denied OR silently ignored...

...in the case of SCMI Telemetry, as an example, it is up to the server expose
to the Linux Agent ONLY what it deems to be safe enough to be shared with normal
world entities without the risk of enabling side channel attacks...

IOW, in the SCMI world, in any protocol, the agents see and live in an
illusion that is created and enforced by the SCMI server, if you are
switching your point of view and start considering how to enforce policies
around SCMI resources at the agent level ("...only root will be able to do
that"), you are already doing it wrong...

Can this view of the platform be absracted, Telemetry-wise, in a common
interface across any other protocol and any other arch ?

It seems to me, again, very unlikely...

Based on the SCMI architecture and the SCMI implementation in Linux, the
only boundary that you can use to identify a 'user' is am SCMI instance
(i.e. one /dev/scmi/tlm_<N>) because that is what the server(s) on the other
side can identify as a distinct agent and that it can fed with a well defined
set of resources at enumeration time...especially in the case of Telemetry
it seems dificult to be able to partition resources at the agent side...

As it was with the defunct Filesyste approach, I would NOT in general
enfore any policy on configuration...last config request will win PLUS
a generation counter to spot unexpected reconfig happening in background...

If you are using 2 tools or daemons to configure telemetry on the same
system in a conflicting way, it is NONE of kernel businness, you have a
misconfigured platform..

Last but NOT least, I think that maybe a Telemetry framework subsystem
could be instead useful for future possible in-kernel users of Telemetry
(you may have mentioned that too..) ... should someone decide to use this
type of data in-kernel, it would certainly be useful to a have common
in-kernel API to consume these data no matter which is the provider from
which that data is collected...

...BUT, again, in this case we do NOT even have a single user as of now
to model this intefrcae against, since we are currently NOT using SCMI
Telemetry for that...so it is seems even more a remote/impossible thing
to get something like this upstream for now...

Thanks,
Cristian
