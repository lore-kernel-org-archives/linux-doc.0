Sure, but are you going to now forward all random tool reviews that are
run on your subsystem to all of these lists (your distribution cc: is
quite large here)?

That is assuming that you can fix up the AI reviews, is that happening
here?

It just seemed odd, and might get crazy over time if this happens for
all random AI tools that happen to be popping up now, right?  If this is
the "official" one for -mm, that's fine, but consider the distribution
