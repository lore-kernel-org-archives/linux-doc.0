Absolutely. The application only cares about atomicity of creating
a certain file/dir with specific size/xattrs with a certain name.

Funny, I once told that story and one Dave Chinner told me
"Nice story, but wrong.":
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10576303/#22190719

You pointed to the minor detail that sync_file_range() uses
WB_SYNC_NONE.
So yes, I agree, it is a nice story and we need to make it right,
by having an API (perhaps SYNC_FILE_RANGE_ALL).
When you pointed out my mistake, I switched the application to
use the FIEMAP_FLAG_SYNC API as a hack.

Thanks a lot, Dave, for taking the time to fill in the gaps in my sketchy
requirement and for the detailed answer.

Besides tests and documentation what could be useful is a portable
user space library that just does the right thing for every filesystem.
For example, safe_rename(), could be properly documented and is
all the application developer should really care about. The default
implementation just does fdatasync() before rename and from here
things can only improve based on underlying filesystem and available
kernel APIs.

I am not volunteering to write that library, but I'd be happy to write
write the patch/tests/man page for SYNC_FILE_RANGE_ALL API
or whatever we want to call it, if we can agree that it is needed.

Thanks!
Amir.
