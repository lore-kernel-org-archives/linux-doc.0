I agree it has the problem of magic number.  That said, I expect common systems
wouldn't have that many problematic large holes.  If it is not clearly wrong,
I'd consider starting with magic number 2.  I feel magic number 2 is appealing
probably because we could reuse vaddr's code in the case.  But it would already
be much better than nothing in the problematic setups.  At least it will cover
your 5 TiB hole.

Depending on what we learn from the fields, we could change the magic number or
add more optimizations in future.  Setting N as a fraction of max_nr_regions
and/or handling holes based on their size (relative to real System RAMs?) are a
few ideas off the top of my head.

Thank you for clarifying!  Let's keep this brainstorm level discussion, then.

Sounds interesting.  Btw, there are multiple ways to do per-cgroup monitoring.
Using DAMOS_STAT with memcg DAMOS filter is one of the ways.  Data
access-as-a-data-attribute patch series [1] will allow doing that in a much
more lightweight and flexible way.

No worry!  FYI, using subject tag 'RFC' could be a good way to make the
intention more explicit, if you want.
