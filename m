Makes sense, thank you for investigating and sharing this!

I'm not fully understanding your point.  min_region_sz is only 4 KiB by
default, and anyway DAMON cannot create regions of size smaller than
min_region_sz.  I cannot get how this helps.

I'm still not convinced with this.  What if the number of discrete system ram
areas is larger than max_nr_regions?

Actually I was also thinking about this problem for in the past.  One of my
idea at that time was, handle only a few largest holes that practically being
problems.  That is, while reading the system ram layout, find the holes, sort
those by size, and do make holes in DAMON regions layout for the biggest N
(say, 2) holes.  This may handle most cases including your 5 TiB hole.
Actually vaddr is doing this, so we may be able to reuse some of the code.

If it makes sense to you, I will try to implement this.

It is arguable, but I believe this also makes sense in my opinion.

Are you actually running DAMON_LRU_SORT or DAMON_RECLAIM in a production system
having 5 TiB hole?  Or, planning to do?  If the above idea makes sense to you,
I could prioritize implementation of it depending on this.
