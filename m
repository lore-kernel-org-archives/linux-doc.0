Yes, I was referring to rename as a commonly used operation used
by application as "metadata barrier".

I wasn't clear:
1. "sparse" meaning no data at all only hole.
2. "exist" meaning found at rename destination
Naturally, its applications responsibility to cleanup temp files that were
not moved into rename destination.

Yes, that results in temp files that would be cleaned up on recovery.

There is no data in my use case, only metadata, that is why
SOMC without fsync is an option.

So I re-state my claim above after having explained the use case.
IMO, SOMC guaranties is an important feature even in the absence
of any fsync, because of the ability to use some metadata operation
(e.g. rename, link) as metadata barriers.
I am wrong about this?

Thanks,
