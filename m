Ok. Maybe it can also be a macro to get the u32 and then some more
macros on top of that to pick out the major/minor/step out of the u32
that you read.

Not that I'm aware of. It's really up to you to decide.

Ok, but that would basically be some code consolidation around picking a
bandwidth and enabling/disabling? It sounds like it could go into either
the serial interface drivers or into the runtime PM path of the wrapper.

Hmm sounds like the round rate should happen on the parent of the
se_clk, and this wrapper DT binding should get the clk for the parent of
the se->clk to run round_rate() on. Then it could all be done in probe,
which sounds good.

It would be a good idea to check with some other people on the dma_ops
suggestion. Maybe add the DMA mapping subsystem folks to help out here

That's fine, but I mean to have struct geni_wrapper *wrapper, and then
struct geni_wrapper; in this file. Children won't know details and we
get slightly more type safety.
