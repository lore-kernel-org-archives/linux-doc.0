Sure, but again this is orthognal to what we are discussing here:
the user visible ordering of metadata operations after a crash.

If anyone implements a multi-segment or per-inode journal (say, like
NOVA), then it is up to that implementation to maintain the ordering
guarantees that a SOMC model requires. You can implement whatever
fsync() go-fast bits you want, as long as it provides the ordering
behaviour guarantees that the model defines.

IOWs, Ted, I think you have the wrong end of the stick here. This
isn't about optimising fsync() to provide better performance, it's
about guaranteeing order so that fsync() is not necessary and we
improve performance by allowing applications to omit order-only
synchornisation points in their workloads.

i.e. an order-based integrity model /reduces/ the need for a
hyper-optimised fsync operation because applications won't need to
use it as often.

Cheers,

Dave.
